This repository contains the code for the Utility-Driven Conformal Prediction paper published at ICLR 2025. We provide all the necessary code to reproduce the experiments in the paper.

## Download Artifacts

Our method builds on top of predictions from a neural network that predicts the softmax scores for an image. We provide the predictions and all the artifacts to run our method in a [Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cmpatino/utility_driven_prediction). You can download all the artifacts by running

```bash
python download_artifacts.py
```

This will download the `utility_input_artifacts` and the `hierarchy_artifacts` directories that contain the necessary files to run our method.

## Running the Experiments

To run the experiments, you can use the main.py script specifying the configuration through a configuration file. We provide the configuration files for all the experiments in the `configs` directory. For example, to replicate the results on the Fitzpatrick dataset you can run

```bash
python main.py configs/fitzpatrick.json --log_parquet
```

While reproducing the results, keep in mind of the runtimes of the experiments as some of them can take a long time to run. The order of magnitude using a machine with 8 CPU cores are:
1. Fitzpatrick + Fitzpatrick Clean (`fitzpatrick.json`): < 10 min
2. iNaturalist (`inaturalist.json`): ~ 1 hour
3. CIFAR-100 (`cifar.json`): ~ 1 hour
4. ImageNet (`imagenet.json`): ~ 12 hours

### Parameters
* `probabilities_ids`: List of directories in the `utility_input_artifacts` directory that contain the softmax scores and other required artifacts.
* `lambdas`: List of lambdas to evaluate for the methods that require it. Recall that lambda is a hyperparameter that controls the influence of the utility term in the conformal prediction method.
* `alphas`: Target statistical coverage.
* `loss_functions`: List of methods to evaluate corresponding to the methods in the paper. The available methods are:
  * Cumulative: Penalized Conformal on a separable loss function.
  * NeymanPearson: Separable Penalized Ratio.
  * MarginalMax: Penalized Conformal on a non-separable loss function.
  * GreedyMax: Greedy Optimizer on Max.
  * GreedyCoverageFunction: Greedy Optimizer on Coverage.

## Reproducing Tables and Plots

If you run the code on the previous section, you will generate a parquet file with the results of the experiments. To reproduce the tables and plots in the paper, you can use the scripts available in the `plotting` directory.
